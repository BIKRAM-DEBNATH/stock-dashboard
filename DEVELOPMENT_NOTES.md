# Development Approach & Technical Implementation

## Development Approach
I adopted a systematic full-stack development approach, breaking the project into distinct phases: database design, API development, frontend implementation, AI integration, and deployment configuration. This methodical approach ensured each component was thoroughly tested before integration.

## Technologies Used
**Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design
**Backend**: Next.js API routes providing RESTful endpoints for company data and stock prices
**Database**: Mock data system with SQL scripts for easy migration to PostgreSQL/SQLite
**Charting**: Recharts library for interactive stock price and volume visualizations
**AI Prediction**: Custom algorithm combining moving averages, trend analysis, and volume indicators
**Deployment**: Docker containerization with Vercel deployment, including comprehensive CI/CD setup

## Key Features Implemented
- Professional dashboard with 12 Indian companies (NSE/BSE)
- Interactive charts showing OHLC data, volume, and price trends
- AI-powered next-day price predictions with confidence metrics
- 52-week high/low tracking and technical indicators
- Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile
- Complete Docker setup for easy deployment

## Challenges Encountered
The primary challenge was implementing realistic AI predictions without overfitting to mock data. I solved this by creating a hybrid algorithm that considers multiple factors: short/long-term moving averages, price momentum, and volume patterns. Another challenge was ensuring responsive chart rendering across devices, resolved through careful Recharts configuration and CSS Grid layouts.

The result is a production-ready fintech application demonstrating full-stack development skills, AI integration, and professional deployment practices.
